# SummerAnsari-PowerBI_Crop_Recommendation_Dashboard
A Crop Recommendation Dashboard is a user-friendly, data-driven tool designed to help farmers, agronomists, and agricultural planners select the most suitable crop for a given region. The dashboard uses the average environmental conditions (such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall) and soil nutrient levels (such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pH) to suggest crops likely to thrive under those conditions.

Features:
Data Input: The user can input or view average environmental data and soil nutrient levels for a particular region or field.
Environmental conditions include:
Average temperature
Humidity levels
Rainfall patterns
Soil nutrients include:
Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
pH value

Crop Recommendation: Based on the input data, the dashboard uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and recommend the most suitable crops for optimal yield. The model is trained to identify crops best suited to specific environmental and soil conditions.

Visualization:
The dashboard typically includes visual elements such as:
Graphs and charts showing the distribution of environmental conditions and nutrient levels. Suggested crop list along with crop profiles, including ideal growth conditions.

Customization:
Users can adjust environmental conditions or nutrient values to simulate changes in weather patterns or soil management, and instantly see the impact on crop recommendations.

Insights & Reports: The dashboard may provide insights on:
Best crop rotation options. Nutrient deficiencies and suggested soil improvements. Forecast of crop yield based on historical data.

Use Case:
A farmer can input the temperature, humidity, rainfall, and nutrient levels for their farm, and the dashboard will suggest the best crops to plant (e.g., rice, maize, or wheat), taking into account both environmental conditions and soil health. This enables better decision-making to ensure crop success and improved productivity.
